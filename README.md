What we'll cover: 
Who we are & Why we're doing this
General time line
Example Apps
Introduction to the Apps Framework  
Resources 

Who we are: James Peterson & Jordan Wheelock. We're doing this because it's imperative to not write off all apps questions as "custom coding" when it is in our scope of knowledge to provide documentation and assistance regarding Zendesk Apps. 

Timeline: We'll work together to create a Zendesk App, meeting two or three times per month on Fridays. This could probably take around 5 months. 

Example Apps: Pop Pop, James's app. 

Introduction to the Apps Framework: 
Framework: A layered structure indicating what kind of programs can or should be built and how they would interrelate. 
Zendesk App: A Zendesk app is most commonly thought of as a ticket sidebar app, such as the time tracking app that we use on support.zendesk.com. However a Zendesk app may also be a top bar app, or navigation bar app (left side bar).
